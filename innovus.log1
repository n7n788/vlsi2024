RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design mips32.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'mips32' of instances=2221 and nets=2467 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design mips32.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'mips32' of instances=2221 and nets=2467 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design mips32.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'.
